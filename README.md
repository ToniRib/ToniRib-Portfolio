## Toni Rib's Online Portfolio

This portfolio uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery to create a site that houses all of the projects I have worked on so far. Each project has an image created with Adobe Illustrator, a short description of the project, and links to both the GitHub repo and the site itself.
